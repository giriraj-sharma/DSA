Knapsack Problems
-> Fractional Knapsack (greedy)
-> 0-1 Knapsack
-> Unbounded Knapsack


0-1 Knapsack (either we add that item or dont add that item)
ex. laptop, computer, pen, tablet

Unbounded Knapsack -> this is like 0-1 knapsack but each item is available in unlimited quantity, so we can take the same item multiple times
