Dynamic programming 
-> approach
-> optimized recursion
-> used to optimize time complexity

Optimal Substructure -> the problem to which we can break in smaller problem. then the solution of smaller problems merged to get the big problem solution 
(optimal means where we find -> smallest, largest, greatest, max profit)
Over lapping SubProblem (recursion with choices i.e. multiple branches) -> when same sub problem in different different recursive subtree.


Types of Dynamic Programming:

MEMOIZATION             TABULATION (more optimised in term of SC)
------------           -------------
Recursive               iterative
top down dp             bottom up dp
largest to smallest     smallest to largest
